********************************************************************************

#### ANNOUNCEMENT

Since the previous author deleted his Github account, this package was missing.
I took the liberty to update it appropriately for Laravel 5.
Here are the changes from the original package :


#### REMOVED SNIPPETS

	- Form (removed from framework)


#### NEW SNIPPETS

	- App
	- Auth
	- Config
	- Crypt
	- Event
	- Hash
	- Log
	- Storage


#### WORK IN PROGRESS

	- Route : Need some clean up, currently as-is from original package
	- Request : A lot of functions are currently missing
	- Eloquent snippets
	- DB Facade snippets
	- Localization snippets
	- And more, I want full coverage of the framework
